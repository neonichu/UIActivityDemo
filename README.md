# UIActivityDemo #

This project aims to demonstrate how to use UIActivities in general and
also how to use several third-party ones. 

### Note ###

Before opening the Xcode project, make sure you compile the external
dependencies by running the _build-external.sh_ script from the
command-line. It will update the submodules and build a static universal
library for FlattrKit.
